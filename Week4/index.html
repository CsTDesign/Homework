            <h2 class="heading">Experience</h2>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in the November Full Stack Web Development cohort through SavvyCoders. After graduation in January 2024, my aim is to land a web developer position in the St Louis area.</p>
            <p>For now, my lesson plans include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="lang-item">HTML</span>
                    <p>Hypertext Markup Language uses multiple pairs of tags to form the basic structure of your website.</p>
                </li>
                <li><span class="lang-item">CSS</span>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets use various selectors and properties for each HTML tag, class, and ID to give a visually-pleasing aesthetic to your website.</p>
                </li>
                <li><span class="lang-item">JavaScript</span>
                    <p>JavaScript uses functions and objects to make your website functional.</p>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="lang-subitem">SPA's & APIs</span>
                        <p>The ultimate aim of the Full Stack Web Development cohort is to build a functioning single-page application. Learning a year or two of coding in a matter of months will be challenging, but the end result is worth it!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="lang-subitem">Node.js</span>
                        <p>A handy environment for building server-side and network applications through JavaScript.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="lang-subitem">GitHub</span>
                        <p>Programmers hardly work alone, and GitHub allows you to work with other programmers on the same project without overwriting another's work.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><span class="lang-item">Career Planning</span>
                    <p>Special thanks to Laurie Wilson, Barbe Rodriguez, David Roberts, and the fine Teacher's Assistants of SavvyCoders for offering help to place students and graduates into their next career.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
